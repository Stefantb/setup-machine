# Do

1. Set up a connection to github. 
    This might be creating a new key or copying .ssh settings from another machine. 
    ``` bash
    # Once had to fix permissions on the .ssh directory
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
    ```

2. Run the script to setup the system.
    ``` bash
    # E.G.
    ./setup-pop-22.sh
    ```
